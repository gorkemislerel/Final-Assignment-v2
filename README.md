# Python Project for Data Science
Python Project for Data Science,Final Assignment-v2


In this project, I showed the work I did for the project requested in the Python Project for Data Science course given by IBM. First, after installing the necessary libraries, I extracted the stock data with yfinance. Then I maximized the period and assigned it to Tesla_data. In the next stage, I used the url and assigned it as html_data and then used BeautifulSoup(). Then I read the income as pd.read_html and changed the name of the columns. I applied the same operations for Gme, got the data and edited it. But I had some trouble removing the dollar symbols here. I finally succeeded. Later, since the use of infer_datetime_format created a user warning in my codes, I removed this code from the previous lines and created the graph. And so, after drawing the graphs, the project was completed.
